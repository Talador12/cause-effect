Files to submit:
	Filled in Cause/Effect Object
	Effect Action Class/Cause evaluation
	Edit Backend
	Edit Frontend

1. Submitting cause or effect files for updates
	Developer looks at files, approves, then adds to appropriate folders.
	Developer adds one database insert to add the new cause/effect.

2. Plugin Market
	Users can upload their own cause/effect types, and other users can view
	these items similar to the google play market (or potentially on the
	market itself) and download the plugins which will modify their installation

3. Local User Generated files
	The user can include files on their phone and the .apk will work with the 
	local files to run the user's generated code.

4. Cause/Effect Creation Screens
	On the application itself, causes and effects can be created using a flow similar to the rule creation design.
