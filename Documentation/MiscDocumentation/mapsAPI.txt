Here's what I did to update my laptop to the desktop pushed head:
1. Pull from the head.
2. Update to the head.
3. Start Eclipse.
4. Refresh your project files.
5. Open MapPicker.java
6. Ensure you have the latest version (v2) of the Google Play Services installed.
     Select Window > Android SDK Manager or run android at the command line.
     Scroll to the bottom of the package list and select Extras > Google Play services. The Google Play services (install all google play features) SDK is downloaded      to your computer and installed in your Android SDK environment at <android-sdk-folder>/extras/google/google_play_services/
7. Add the Google Play Services project into your Eclipse workspace.
     Click File -> Import..., select Android -> Existing Android Code into Workspace
     Browse to and select <android-sdk-folder>/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib
8. To add the dependency to Google Play Services into your project
     Project -> Properties -> Android -> Library, Add -> google-play-services_lib
9. Run the code
10. If you go to New Rule>Cause+>Arriving at a Location, you will see a blank but not breaking map app. This will load a map (as it does on my desktop) once we update the keystore for all of us. For now, this is enough work.

DEBUG.KEYSTORE (IMPORTANT, used to load the map)
1. Pull from the repository. There will be a debug.keystore file in the head directory.
2. Copy this file
3. Go to your .Android directory (usually listed under your user file)
4. Rename your old keystore to old.keystore
5. Copy the new debug.keystore into the folder
6. Run the app in eclipse. 
	-If the application wants a reinstallation of the app (due to different signatures), uninstall the application on         the device via Settings>Applications>Uninstall and then rerun the program in eclipse.
