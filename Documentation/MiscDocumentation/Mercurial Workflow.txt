When you’re working on a team, your workflow is going to look a lot like this:

1. If you haven’t done so in a while, get the latest version that everyone else is working off of:
	- hg pull
	- hg up
2. Make some changes
3. Commit them (locally)
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until you’ve got some nice code that you’re willing to inflict on everyone else
5. When you’re ready to share:
	- hg pull to get everyone else’s changes (if there are any)
	- hg merge to merge them into yours
	- test! to make sure the merge didn’t screw anything up
	- hg commit (the merge)
	- hg push
