Types need to be stored in camel casing, no spaces

e.g. wifi, phoneCall, textMessage, time


TIME:

	the Time object in android has a toString function that displays time in 
	YYYYMMDDThhmmss followed by time zone information with hours being in military format

	parameters: HH:mm

	it would be most helpful if parameters for time were stored as "HH:mm" in military format
	no parsing during evaluation would be necessary if they were stored in this fashion



TEXT MESSAGES:

	Helpful information to store in a text message parameter:

	From:contact name

	Any of these fields can be blank, store as:

	"Frank Furter"

	- Wrap the message in single quotes to avoid parsing troubles if the message has commas



PHONE CALLS:

	Helpful information to store in a phone call:

	From:contact name

	Store as:

	"Super Mario"


SSID:
	parameters for a wifi SSID rCause: "SSID goes here"
	enum value = ssid


WIFI STATUS:
	parameters for a wifi status rCause: "on" or "off"
	enum value = wifiStatus
