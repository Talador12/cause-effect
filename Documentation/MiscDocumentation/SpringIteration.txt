Iteration 7
"Raley" stuff
1. Tomin      You’re creating too many new Activities. Every time you enter a new screen, it looks like you’re adding a new activity. Even if you’re returning to a screen you have already been to, you have a new activity for it. Tim mentioned this in the meeting, but you should only go 2-3 activities deep and then as you complete a screen or press the back key begin popping those activities off the stack.
2. Matty B    Whenever I create a “Cause,” a second identical cause is added in the Cause list. Fix that so only the ONE is created.
a. Matty B    This bug reveals another one. If a user has identical “causes” they should combine into one. You don’t need duplicates. Also, in doing that you won’t repeat playing the same effects over again for the identical cause.
3. Keith      When a “Cause” is phone call and you have an “Effect” of toast, when phone receives a call, it doesn’t display the correct toast text. Instead it says, “Incoming call from xxxxxxxxxx.”
4. Keith      When a “Cause” is phone call and you have an “Effect” of notification, when phone receives a call, no notification is shown.
5. Will/Matty B (get all rules by type, not category)      After turning off the previous rule, effects were still played.
6. Keith      When a “Cause” is text message and you have an “Effect” of toast, when phone receives a text, it doesn’t display the correct toast text. Instead it says, “Message received xxxxxxxxxx.”
7. Keith      When a “Cause” text message and you have an “Effect” of notification, when phone receives a text, no notification is shown.
8. Will/Matty B (get all rules by type, not category)      After turning off the previous rule, effects were still played.
