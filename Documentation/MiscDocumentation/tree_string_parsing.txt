$ escape char
+ or
& and
1 empty node

string sequence must be correct or failure


+:&:1@:1@@:&:1@:1$ - depth first

sequence must always start with +, &, or 1 (only 1 cause)


		+
	&		&
    1	    1	    1	    1


create causes using ids from the cause list and insert them into the empty nodes

		+
	&		&
    c1	    c2	    c3	    c4

evaluate using cause functions that return booleans (isActive()?)


WHAT I NEED FROM DATABASE (for cause tree evaluation)
- parse string for tree creation
- cause information based on cause list
	- request information based on id in the cause list - getCause(id); (helper class?)
